# Introduction
This repository contains code used to analyze mechanical structure and mechanical function data in the manuscript "Mechanical response of cardiac microtissues to acute localized injury" by Shoshana L Das, Bryan Sutherland, Emma Lejeune, Jeroen Eyckmans, and Christopher S Chen (link forthcoming). There are two separate codes included in this repository -- see the "Object_Segmentation" folder and the "Strain_Analysis" folder. 

# Part 1: Myofibril Segmentation

# Part 2: Strain Analysis
